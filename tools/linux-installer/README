In order to use Magic Set Editor, you need to have libraries for wxGTK version
2.8. This can be acquired from the Ubuntu/Debian package libwxgtk2.8-0. If you
are using another distribution, you can probably find the library in a package
somewhere.

To install Magic Set Editor, please extract this tarball if you haven't already,
and then run the install script. If run as root, it will install MSE to
/usr/share/local/magicseteditor, if not, to ~/.magicseteditor.

MSE will also place a symlink in either /usr/local/bin or ~/bin. They can be
removed without affecting the install, and removing the installation directory
will completely purge the system of MSE, except that some users' configuration
files will still remain in ~/.magicseteditor for each user.

Fonts are not included with MSE currently, you will have to seek those out
yourself.
