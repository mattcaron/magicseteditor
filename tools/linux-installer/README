In order to use Magic Set Editor, you need to have libraries for wxGTK version 2
.8. This can be acquired from the Ubuntu package libwxgtk2.8-0.

To install Magic Set Editor, please extract this tarball if you haven't already,
and then run the install script as root. Unfortunately, Magic Set Editor
currently requires that it be installed to /usr/local/share/magicseteditor. If,
after Magic Set Editor is installed, it complains about being unable to find
data in a certain path, then your system is slightly different, and should be
installed to that directory, minus the "/data". This can be done by setting the
MSE_INSTALL_DIR environment variable. After the install script is run and
loading is confirmed, you may delete all the contents of this tarball if you
wish.

Magic Set Editor stores data only in the primary installation directory, a
symlink to the executable at /usr/local/bin, and in ~/.magicseteditor.
If you need to uninstall, removing these directories should completely
purge your system.

The installation directory of MSE is specified by the MSE_INSTALL_DIR
environment variable, and the destination of the executable symlink is set with
MSE_EXEC_SYMLINK.
