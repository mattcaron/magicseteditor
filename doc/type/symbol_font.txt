File type: Symbol font

--Overview--

A symbol font is a font for drawing with images.
Each [[type:symbol font symbol|symbol-font-symbol]] in the font is an image.

A symbol font is referenced in [[type:stylesheet]]s using a [[type:symbol font reference]].

--Splitting--

A piece of text drawn with the symbol font is split into separate symbols.
The list of symbols in the font is scanned from top to bottom to find matches.

If the text is for instance "W/GR" and "W/G" should be rendered as a single symbol, then it should appear before the symbol "W".
Otherwise the "W" is seen as a symbol and the program continues with rendering "/GR".

--Font size--

A symbol font is drawn using a specific point size, similair to normal fonts.
Usually the images that make up the font are given in a very high resolution, for example 200x200.
This resulution could correspond to a point size of for instance 150pt.

When the symbol is drawn at for instance 12pt the image well then be scalled down to @200/150*12 == 16@ pixels.

Sizes like margin, padding and font size are given in 'pixels per point'. If for instance
> text margin left: 0.1
is specified, and the symbol is rendered at 12pt, the margin will be @12*0.1 == 1.2@ pixels.

--Package format--

A symbol font is described in a [[file:package]] with the <tt>.mse-symbol-font</tt> file extension.
Such a package contains a [[file:format|data file]] called <tt>symbol-font</tt> that has the following properties.
